## [Unreleased] [1.4.0]
### Added
- New CHANGELOG file following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) specification.
- Import/Export flow so the state of xBull Wallet can be moved from one app to another one (example from a phone version to an extension version)

### Fixed
- On website versions, sometimes when first launching the app it started on the `create-account` page. Now it's always starting at the homepage (unless there is no wallet created yet).
